# 2022 S1 COMP30024 Artificial Intelligence Project

> Cachex is a perfect-information two-player game played on an n × n rhombic, hexagonally tiled board, based on the strategy game Hex.

## Project Part A: Searching

This part of project will solve a simple search-based problem on _Cachex_ game board by implmeneting a heuristic, A* path finding algorithm.  

The aims for Project Part A is build a agent that:
- refresh Pyhon programming skills
- explore algorithms learned in lecture
- familiar with Cachex

## Project Part B: Competitive Game Agent

## _Cache_ Game

Cachex is a perfect-information two-player game played on an n×nrhombic, hexagonally tiled board, based on the strategy game Hex. Two players (named Red and Blue) compete, with the goal to form a connection between the opposing sides of the board corresponding to their respective color. More information please check **[AI_chachex_spec.pdf]("https://github.com/chuangyu-hscy/legendary-succotash/blob/master/COMP30024%20Project/COMP30024%20Project%20Part%20A/specification/AI_cachex_spec.pdf")**.


## Project Dependencies

Due to science faculty assessment marking constraints that the tests will run with **python 3.6** on the student **Unix** machines. 
Hence authors using conda to build the working environment.

```bash
# please check the conda_env.txt file and requirements.txt file does exist
# create conda environment
conda create -n COMP30024 --file conda_env.txt

# after set up conda environment, please install package dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**TO RUN IMPLMENTED CODE**

Most of algorithm and code logic and structure are implemented via a jupyter notebook. Then convert into various `.py` files.

To test the completed code, please run the line below.

```
# activate conda environment first
conda activate COMP30024

# run the main program
python3 main.py
```
